### Â¡Hola!ðŸ‘‹ I'm JesÃºs VelÃ¡zquez
###### *Electrical Engineer | Software Developer | Homebrewer*
:round_pushpin: Mexico (UTC-5)

I've developed applications for the past 3+ years, focused on optimizing and improving existing processes. My tech stack is not written on stone, I believe on choosing the right tool for the job. So far, I've used javascript (Node, Express, Vue, React, Electron), HTML, CSS, Python and Matlab.

When I'm away from keyboard, I like to cook, play football, brew something (mead, beer, coffee) or get some home improvement done. I'm into Sci-Fi and fantasy novels, movies, videogames and TV shows. [Here's a PDF version of my CV (92 KB)](https://tepexic.com/CV_JesusVelazquez.pdf)

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, React, Tailwind, Bootstrap
* Backend: Python, ExpressJS
* Desktop: Matlab, Electron
